Hi, I'm Purva Athnere ,  a final-year Computer Science student who loves coding and building useful projects. I enjoy solving problems and learning new things, especially by working on real-time projects. I’ve also contributed to open source through GirlScript Summer of Code. Right now, I’m focusing on backend development and preparing for job roles in 2025.
